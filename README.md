# PR1 - Daily Deck

The Daily Deck is a website used to quickly check multiple sources of information and media at one time.

This is useful for users who don't have a lot of time to check and switch between multiple apps/websites.

In this project we used elements from the following APIs:

-   Youtube
-   Spotify
-   OpenWeather
-   Media Stack
-   Financial Modeling Prep

The majority of Daily Deck was constructed using the Bulma framework with additional custom CSS.
